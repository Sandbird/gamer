Contributing
=====

This app is open source from the start so that everyone can help in developing it.

All data in the GiantBomb Wiki comes from its users, and a great way to improve this app is contributing to the wiki, therefore I encourage you to create an account on [GiantBomb](http://www.giantbomb.com) and help in making it even better.

For features, bugs or suggestions, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/caiomello/gamer/issues) with the appropriate labels, or [send an email](mailto:gamer.app@icloud.com).

I've also created a [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/RlCG5Bxi/gamer) so you can check on the ideas I've had and what I'm currently doing.
