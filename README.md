This app is open source from the start so that everyone can help in developing it.

All data in the GiantBomb Wiki comes from its users, and a great way to improve this app is contributing to the wiki, therefore I encourage you to create an account on [GiantBomb](http://www.giantbomb.com) and help in making it even better.
